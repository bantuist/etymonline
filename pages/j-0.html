<dd class="highlight">10th letter of the English alphabet, pronounced "jay," as in "kay" for <span class="foreign">-k-</span>, but formerly written out as <span class="foreign">jy</span>, rhyming with <span class="foreign">-i-</span> and corresponding to French <span class="foreign">ji</span>.
<BR><BR>
one of the most stable English letters (it has almost always the same sound), it is a latecomer to the alphabet and originally had no sound value. The letter itself began as a scribal modification of Roman <span class="foreign">-i-</span> in continental Medieval Latin. The scribes added a "hook" to small <span class="foreign">-i-</span>, especially in the final position in a word or roman numeral, to distinguish it from the strokes of other letters. The dot on the <span class="foreign">-i-</span> (and thus the <span class="foreign">-j-</span>) and the capitalization of the pronoun <a href="/index.php?term=I&allowed_in_frame=0" class="crossreference">I</a> are other solutions to the same problems.
<BR><BR>
In English, <span class="foreign">-j-</span> was used as a roman numeral throughout Middle English, but the letter <span class="foreign">-y-</span> was used to spell words ending an "i" sound, so <span class="foreign">-j-</span> was not needed to represent a sound. Instead, it was introduced into English c. 1600-1640 to take up the consonantal sound that had evolved from the Roman <span class="foreign">i-</span> since Late Latin times. In Italian, <span class="foreign">g-</span> was used to represent this, but in other languages <span class="foreign">j-</span> took the job. This usage is attested earliest in Spanish, where it was in place before 1600.
<blockquote>
No word beginning with J is of Old English derivation. [OED]
</blockquote>
English dictionaries did not distinguish words beginning in <span class="foreign">-i-</span> and <span class="foreign">-j-</span> until 19c., and <span class="foreign">-j-</span> formerly was skipped when letters were used to express serial order.
<BR><BR>
In Latin texts printed in modern times, <span class="foreign">-j-</span> often is used to represent Latin <span class="foreign">-i-</span> before <span class="foreign">-a-</span>, <span class="foreign">-e-</span>, <span class="foreign">-o-</span>, <span class="foreign">-u-</span> in the same syllable, which in Latin was sounded as the consonant in Modern English <span class="foreign">you</span>, <span class="foreign">yam</span>, etc., but the custom has been controversial among Latinists:
<blockquote>
The character <span class="foreign">J</span>, <span class="foreign">j</span>, which represents the letter sound in some school-books, is an invention of the seventeenth century, and is not found in MSS., nor in the best texts of the Latin authors. [Lewis]
</blockquote>
In English words from Hebrew, <span class="foreign">-j-</span> represents <span class="foreign">yodh</span>, which was equivalent to English consonantal <span class="foreign">y</span> (hence <span class="foreign">hallelujah</span>) but many of the Hebrew names later were conformed in sound to the modern <span class="foreign">-j-</span> (compare <a href="/index.php?term=Jesus&allowed_in_frame=0" class="crossreference">Jesus</a>).</dd>

<dd>c. 1300 (c. 1200 in surnames) "a jail, prison; a birdcage." The form in <span class="foreign">j-</span> is from Middle English <span class="foreign">jaile</span>, from Old French <span class="foreign">jaiole</span> "a cage; a prison," from Medieval Latin <span class="foreign">gabiola</span> "a cage," from Late Latin <span class="foreign">caveola</span>, diminutive of Latin <span class="foreign">cavea</span> "a cage, enclosure, stall, coop; a hollow place, a cavity" (see <a href="/index.php?term=cave&allowed_in_frame=0" class="crossreference">cave</a> (n.)).
<BR><BR>
The form in <span class="foreign">g-</span> was the more usual in Middle English manuscripts (<span class="foreign">gaile</span>, also <span class="foreign">gaiole</span>), from Old French <span class="foreign">gaiole</span> "a cage; a prison," a variant spelling that seems to have been frequent in Old North French, which would have been the system familiar to Norman scribes. Now pronounced "jail" however it is spelled. Persistence of <span class="foreign">gaol</span> (preferred in Britain) is "chiefly due to statutory and official tradition" [OED], and, probably, the fact that it is known the Americans spell it the other way.
<BR><BR>
In U.S. usually a place of confinement for petty offenders. The Medieval Latin word also is the source of Spanish <span class="foreign">gayola</span>, Italian <span class="foreign">gabbiula</span>.
